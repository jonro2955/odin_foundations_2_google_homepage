# Google Homepage https://jonro2955.github.io/odin_foundations_2_google_homepage/

This is the 2nd project in The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. 

The goal is to make a visual clone of the Google search homepage using basic HTML, CSS and some image resources. 

What I learned:

- Set up a organized webpage file folder with sub folders for images, stylesheets, etc and link them together in html.

- Link a reset stylesheet to run before other style sheets to clear any styles previously set.

- Html file naming conventions like index.html. and main.css.

- Use vscode to write code, review code, and open a html document in a browser and reload it after every save.

- Use inspect tool in browser.

- Use essential html page structure: DOCTYPE html, html lang="en", head, body and then the contents go inside the body usually in the form of header, nav, main, footer, etc, which are all like standard div elements but with more descriptive names and features used to improve accessibility, readability and functionality.

- Insert images and icons from libraries or urls using its unique identifiers or class names in <i> tags after linking a url inside <head>.

- XML: XML was designed to carry data with focus on identifying what the data is. HTML was designed to display data with focus on how data looks. XML tags are not predefined like HTML. XML tags can have the same names as HTML but with different meaning and functions. To use xml in html, an xmlns attribute must be included in an element like this: <svg xmlns="namespaceURI"...></svg>. In the case of this svg tag, an image defined with the xml svg protocol accessed through the XML namespace is used inside an HTML file to display that image.

- Use many ways of moving around a div in css: top/right/bottom/left, margin, padding, align-items, etc. These are usually used in conjuction with position (absolute, relative), display (flex, grid, etc). Also there is the css float property.

- Change hover behaviour with :hover class, and the "cursor" attribute to change the way the mouse pointer appears when hovering over some item.

- Position some elements on top of other elements using absolute positioning and margins.

- Use borders to pinpoint margins and position of an element as you edit.

- Alternate ways of specifying classes or ids for child elements using child identifiers. For example, for p element in some parent, use #parent p{...} . 

- Use git to upload project to github.

- Set up grids to divide page into many different areas and arrange page by placing items in these areas.
